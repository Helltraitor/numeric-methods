### Help function

**Question**: `help` function displays strange characters in documentation instead of my language text on OS Windows

**Solution**: enable Unicode UTF-8 support in region settings

`Settings` > `Time and language` > `Region` > `Addtional date, time & regional settings` > `Region` (if the old control panel is showing) > `Administrative` > `Change system locale` > Check the `Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support` then reload pc
